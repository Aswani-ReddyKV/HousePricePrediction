# Project Name
> House Price Prediction
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

Expectation from this assignment was to build a regression model using concepts learnt in advanced regeressoin module by applying Regularisation concept and find the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## General Information
Using techniques learnt in EDA and Liner regression module need to come out with analysis and identify attributes which are having influence on the bike rentals.
Also need to come out with a prediction model for finding demand for shared bikes.</br>
What are the independent variables present in the given data set and its impact on the bike rentals to be derived.
By having all these details, it will be helpful for the bike rental management team on predicting the bike rentals and be prepared for effective business
