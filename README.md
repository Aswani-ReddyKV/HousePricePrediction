# Project Name
House Price Prediction
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

Expectation from this assignment was to build a regression model using concepts learnt in advanced regeressoin module by applying Regularisation concept and find the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## General Information
Using techniques learnt in EDA,Liner regression and Advanced regression modules need to come out with analysis and identify attributes which are having influence on the house sale price.
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression

Below set of steps where followed to meet the business goal in this assignment.
- Data cleaning
- EDA
    - Univariate Analysis for categorical columns
    - Univariate Analysis for Target variable
    - Univariate Analysis for numerical columns
    - Bivariate Analysis for numerical columns
    - Bivariate Analysis for categorical columns
    - Multivariate Analysis
Data handling

## Conclusions
- Number of features getting used in Ridge and Lasso\
    Features selected by Lasso: 138
    Features present in Ridge: 225
